        <h1>Where we came from?</h1>
        <p>I truly believe that what we are today is little more than the sum of everything we've been through. In other words, basically we are a bunch of things that we once were.
            Therefore, below is a brief report of how these 32 years were I have been walking on this planet.
        </p>

                <p>
                    As all childhoods should be, I didn't have to worry about anything. Which doesn't mean that my 
                    parents didn't have needs, being precisely the opposite, because we went through moments of deep 
                    financial crisis during the change from the Color plan to the Real Plan, having periods of 
                    unemployment and everything that can result in a family. But, we all had a good time, and here 
                    we are today, more mature and experienced (I'm talking about my parents, I was a child and I 
                    only have fond memories).

                <h2 id="00s">00's - Adolescence and Early Youth</h2>
                <p>
                    A period of great changes for all people, adolescence always brings challenges and some insecurity, 
                    but with friends, family and the right orientation it can be a period of great discoveries and 
                    maturation.<br> 
                    I was fortunate to have an adolescence in the same small and quiet town, with the freedom to go 
                    cycling, play ball in the street, fish, swim in rivers and lakes and live without fear.

                <p>
                    I believe that this decade will be the one that had the most changes until the end of my life (not 
                    least because there will be less and less left to change anything). <br>
                    First, move from the quiet city to the state capital - Porto Alegre - which had approximately 2 million 
                    inhabitants at the time, live in a university residence, start a degree in Electrical Engineering, start 
                    playing rugby, graduate, move to Garopaba/SC (city with stunning natural beauty and where I worked as a 
                    support and development manager for Call Center systems based on Asterisk), move back to Porto Alegre and 
                    finally, <b>change country</b> no family, no strong ties of support... <br>
                    As I said before, it's been a decade of <em>lots of change</em>.<br>
                    And before I forget, there was still time to be the national rugby champion here in Portugal.
